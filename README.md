# Flight Delay 2008 EDA
By [Adri√°n Vera Ros](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrianveraros/) 

This was my first Data Science project on my own, developed during autumn 2017. 

Although I had the opportunity to improve it after finishing Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002); I have chosen not to, to keep it as a reminder to myself of all the hard work and illusion behind this first attempt at Data Science. 

If you have any trouble opening the Jupyter Notebook, please use the following [link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AdrianVeraRos/Flight-Delay-Causes-EDA/blob/master/flight-delay-eda-exploratory-data-analysis.ipynb).

## About
According to a 2010 report made by the US Federal Aviation Administration, the economic price of domestic flight delays entails a yearly cost of 32.9 billion dollars to passengers, airlines and other parts of the economy. More than half of that amount comes from the pockets of passengers who not only lose time waiting for their planes to leave, but they also miss connecting flights, spend money on food and have to sleep on hotel rooms while stranded. 

The report, focusing on data from year 2007, estimated that air transportation delays put a 4 billion dollar dent in the country's gross domestic product that year. Full report can be found [here](http://www.isr.umd.edu/NEXTOR/pubs/TDI_Report_Final_10_18_10_V3.pdf).

But, what are the causes for these delays?

In order to answer this question, we are going to analyze the provided dataset, containing up to 1.936.758 different internal flights in the US for 2008 and their causes for delay, diversion and cancellation; if any. 

The data comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). 

The results are tentative.
